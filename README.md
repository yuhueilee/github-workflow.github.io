### Types of Branch
- **Main branch**: Stores the source code in production ready state that can be released.
- **Develop branch**: Stores the latest development changes for the next release.
- **Feature branch**: Dedicated to a single new feature in the project. 
- **Release branch**: Can be used to patch issues discovered in the feature branch. It needs to be merged to both main and develop branches.
